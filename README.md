This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Rust related to mutable references.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that compiles without errors but exhibits unexpected behavior due to multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The `bugSolution.rs` file presents a corrected version, highlighting the importance of carefully managing mutable references to prevent data races and unexpected behavior.  This example is useful for understanding the borrow checker's role in maintaining memory safety and data integrity in Rust.  Always ensure that you don't create multiple mutable references to the same data unless they're completely disjoint in scope.
